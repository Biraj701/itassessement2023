                <h1 >PhotoGraphy</h1>
                <p>Photography is an art form that involves capturing light with a camera to create a visual
                   representation of a moment or scene. This art form has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 19th century and continues to evolve as technology advances.
                    <br><br>
                    Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or 
                    film, to create an image. The word “photography” comes from the Greek words “photos” meaning “light” and “graphos” meaning “drawing” or “writing.” It is a form of visual communication that has become an integral part of our daily lives.
                    One of the defining characteristics of photography is its ability to capture a moment in time. Unlike other art forms such as painting or sculpture, photography allows for a precise and exact representation of a moment. In photojournalism, photographers actively document events and news stories, creating a historical record of unfolding events.
                    Another unique aspect of photography is its ability to manipulate light and composition to create a desired effect. Through the use of various camera settings and techniques, such as depth of field and exposure, photographers can create dramatic and expressive images. The use of light can also be used to create a sense of mood or atmosphere in an image, drawing the viewer in and evoking a response.

                <h1 >Wildlife PhotoGraphy</h1>
                <p>Wildlife photography is a genre of photography concerned with documenting various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat. <br><br>
                    As well as requiring photography skills, wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. For example, some animals and birds are difficult to approach and thus a knowledge of the animal's and birds behavior is needed in order to be able to predict its actions. Photographing some species may require stalking skills or the use of a hide/blind for concealment.While wildlife photographs can be taken using basic equipment, successful photography of some types of wildlife requires specialist equipment, such as macro lenses for insects, long focal length lenses for birds and underwater cameras for marine life.Wildlife photography is about so much more than technical details like aperture and shutter speed. It also goes well beyond the technology in today's latest and greatest cameras. In order to capture a subject's true beauty, it's essential to understand their behavior. By using the internet as a research tool, you can greatly increase your chances of success. For example, as part of my preparation to photograph Harbor Seals, I researched the tidal charts off the coast of Long Island. At low tide the water recedes to reveal large off shore rocks. These boulders are ideal for the seals to rest, and warm up on. Besides determining the best time of day and month to see them, I was also able to determine their approximate GPS coordinates. This knowledge proved invaluable as I found over sixty Seals on a quiet Friday afternoon in February. Ironically enough, I was the only photographer in the area. While it may be impossible to predict all of nature's variables, understanding your subject before heading out is one sure way to separate yourself from the pack.

                    Expect the Unexpected
                    Chris Corradino wildlife  photo dolphin
                    Wildlife waits for no one so you must be ready to shoot in an instant. As soon as you arrive at a location, take the cameras out of your backpack, turn them on, and remove the lens caps. This way, you are prepared for anything that may cross your path. I learned this while on a dolphin watching expedition in Costa Rica. I had a 400mm lens mounted on my tripod as I waited for the first sign of marine activity. Luckily, I also carried a second body with a 17-40mm lens draped over my shoulder. The exposure had already been set for the ambient light. As I scanned the waters through my telephoto lens I heard a collective gasp from the other passengers on the boat. I immediately turned to see a Bottlenose Dolphin completely airborne mere inches from the boat. In a split second I managed to fire 6 frames with the second body. Had I not prepared that camera with the exposure and wide angle lens, I would have missed one of my favorite images from the trip. By expecting the unexpected, you won't be caught off guard.
